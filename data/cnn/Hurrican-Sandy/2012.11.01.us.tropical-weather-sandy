<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.0">The death toll mounted Thursday as survivors struggled to regain a semblance of the normalcy that Superstorm Sandy swept away this week when it struck the Northeast.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.1">In some cases, tempers grew short.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.2">"We're gonna die down here!" wailed Donna Solli to Sen. Chuck Schumer as he toured her waterlogged neighborhood in New York's Staten Island with a group of reporters. "When is the government coming?"</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.3">Solli said residents needed gas, food and clothes. "We're gonna freeze," she said on a day when the 50-degree temperature was predicted to drop to the low 40s. "We've got 90-year-old people!"</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.4">The Democratic senator from New York said he understood and hugged her.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.5">Solli said her basement was flooded and her refrigerator was upside down. "I stayed here because I have an elderly dog," she told a reporter. "We nearly drowned."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.6">Solli added that she had had little to eat. "One slice of pizza in 48 hours."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.7">As he surveyed the damage in the neighborhood, the politician told a reporter, "This is the worst thing I've ever seen, and it's killing me what these people have to go through. We'll get whatever federal help we can, that's for sure."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.8">Afterward, a senior administration official told CNN that a convoy of 10 Red Cross trucks filled with food, water and medicine arrived Thursday evening on Staten Island.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.9">Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and FEMA Deputy Administrator Richard Serino were to travel Friday to Staten Island to meet with state and local officials and view the response and recovery efforts, the White House said.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.10">Some people were not complaining.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.11">About 90 miles north of Staten Island, the mayor of Danbury, Connecticut, Mark D. Boughton, was visiting a special-needs shelter on Wednesday night when he met a 106-year-old woman who had cancer and was in hospice.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.12">"She's happy to be alive," he tweeted. "Every day is a gift."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.13">Contacted by telephone, Boughton said the cheerfulness of the lifelong resident of Danbury had inspired him. "The essence of it was, look, you gotta make each day count," he said. "You don't know when your time comes."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.14">In Sandy's wake, at least 157 people died, at least 88 of them in the United States, two in Canada and 67 in the Caribbean.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.15">Among them were two children whose bodies were found Thursday. The boys, ages 2 and 4, had been riding with their mother, Glenda Moore, on Staten Island when the storm surge swamped their SUV, authorities said.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.16">Police said Moore gave them this account: When her Ford Explorer was blown into a hole, she got out, took out her children and carried them to a nearby tree. There, she held on to the boys, Brandon and Connor, as rain poured and hurricane-strength winds gusted. After hours, she walked with her children to a nearby house to seek help. A man opened the door but refused to let them in. Desperate, she went to his back porch and threw a flower pot at the window in an attempt to get inside. But she was not able to do so. Meanwhile, her children were swept away.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.17">Their bodies were found nearby on Thursday.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.18">Relatives said Moore was too distraught to speak with CNN.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.19">The owner of the house, who asked that he not be identified, disputed Moore's account, saying he saw only a man. "He didn't come to the door, he came on the stairs at the back of the house, and he was standing at the bottom of the stairs," said the man. "He took a concrete flower pot and threw it through the door."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.20">The man at the door, he said, didn't ask to enter the house, but instead asked the owner of the house to leave it in order to help.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.21">"What could I do to help him?" he asked. "I'm wearing the same clothes ... the same shorts and flip-flops I had that night. And I was going to come out?"</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.22">The man told CNN he sat up for the rest of the night, with his back against the door in the kitchen. He said the deaths were a tragedy, but that the woman was at fault. "She shouldn't have been out," he continued. "She shouldn't have been out on the road."</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.23">There was nothing he could have done, he added. "I'm not a rescue worker ... If I would have been outside, I would have been dead."</paragraph>

<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.25">Sandy claimed at least 37 lives in New York City, Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters Thursday.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.27">Authorities in nine states worked to restore basic services such as public transit and electricity.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.28">In New York City, nearly 500,000 customers were without power. In Manhattan, many of the 220,000 customers without electricity were south of Midtown's 34th Street. Parts of Queens and Staten Island also had no electricity Thursday. "Restoring power will take a lot of time," the mayor said.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.29">Gov. Andrew Cuomo, in a letter to utilities, warned of consequences if authorities discover that they failed to prepare properly. "Under such circumstances, I would direct the Public Service Commission to commence a proceeding to revoke your certificates," he wrote.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.30">That message was not lost on its intended targets. "We're doing our damnedest to get our power back as quickly as possible," said John Miksad, senior vice president of electric operations at Con Ed.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.31">New York's vast transit network remains hobbled. The Metropolitan Transit Authority said 14 of the city's 23 subway lines were running and a flotilla of 4,000 buses was attempting to take up the slack. For some, Thursday's commute into Manhattan from the outer boroughs took five hours.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.32">Bloomberg predicted that would ease as tunnels are cleared of water, power is restored to subway lines and ferries resume service.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.33">Electricity or not: Tale of two cities</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.34">Getting water out of the tunnels is "one of the main orders of business right now," Cuomo said.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.35">Broadway theaters reopened Thursday, and organizers vowed to hold the New York City Marathon as scheduled on Sunday. Event organizer Mary Wittenberg said the race wouldn't divert resources from the recovery.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.37">Three days after Sandy barreled ashore in southern New Jersey, search-and-rescue crews were going door-to-door in some neighborhoods looking for people, particularly the elderly, who may have been stranded by the power outages, the debris and remaining floodwater.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.38">Sandy killed at least six people in New Jersey, said Gov. Chris Christie, who had warned people in low-lying areas to evacuate.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.47">The National Weather Service predicted a nor'easter next week from the mid-Atlantic states into New England. But the forecast said the storm would be far weaker than Sandy.</paragraph>
<paragraph id="2012.11.01.us.tropical-weather-sandy.48">CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Tom Watkins, Joe Sterling and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.</paragraph>
